In the back-end my logic has been implemented to run the game smoothly.
On the screen player will see 'Press Enter' then after pressing, the game starts.
The task of the player will be to guess the correct color of any words & not the word itself,& type that color in the textbox present there.
If the guessed color is right then both score & timer will be incremented.
But if the player guesses wrong color then no score will be increased, & time will be flying on a regular basis.
The game ends when time becomes zero seconds.
Thus to play for a longer time the player needs to always keep the state of time in his mind & guess the color right, type fast, & make your score high & beat others.
